# Summary: 
# Checks services set to Automatic and insures they are running. 
# Ignores an array of services such as Performance Logs and Alerts  
# which are set to Automatic but turns themselves off. 
# 
# If an Automatic service is not Running and not in the Ignore array 
# an attempt to restart the service is made. If the service is restarted 
# a Warning is returned. If the service could not be restarted a 
# Critical error is returned. 
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
# Usage: 
# This script does not require any input parameters. 
#    For Nagios NRPE/NSClient++ usage add the following line to the  
#    NSC.ini file after placing this script in Scripts subdirectory. 
#    check_services=cmd /c echo scripts\Test-Automatic-Services.ps1 | powershell.exe -command - 
#    NOTE: The trailing - is required.

# Orgin: 
# This script (or one like it) was originally written by ronald van vugt 
#     (ronald.van.vugt@vanderlet.nl) 
# I took the vbscript\wsf version that he wrote and converted it to  
# PowerShell while adding an array of ignored services and making other 
# slight improvements such as adjusting the WMI query to only return  
# stopped services. 
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
# Notes:  
# Unlike the majority of my scripts this script has rather verbose 
# comments in it. This is both to pay homage to the original author as  
# well as to aid others with learning PowerShell. The original version 
# of this script, the vbscript/wsf version was a vbscript learning 
# experience for myself and the basis of my vbscripts to follow.
